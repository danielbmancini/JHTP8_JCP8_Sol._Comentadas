bi-dimensional movement in arrays: mechanical turtle implements
methods

uses floor 20x20 int[][] in main class
uses pen_state in main class
should use current_block in main class
methods:
1 - switches pen state
2 - switches pen state
3 - introduces 'sentido' - to the right (0)
4 - sentido to the left - to the left (1)
5 - loops index 1 length distance, with support of sentido,current_block and pen state
6 - nested for loops shows 20x20 array (in 2 dimensions)
9 - System.exits (0)

run class extends methods, checks for negative inputs and denies it
