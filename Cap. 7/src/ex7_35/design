roughly,
the virtual computer should consist of buses, an ALU, and other 'circuitry'.

the physicality of the 'circuitry' can be expressed or distinguished by using individual classes.

the main class can be called the 'cpu', and can contain the final ints, whose usage is mediated by a switch expression.

scanning - in the form of "Object object = scanner.nextObject()" - will be understood as the register, and the register memory (if a register only stores instructions).
